            <span class="first-paragraph">Russian-born Telegram boss Pavel Durov was released on bail
            after being placed un<wbr>der formal investigation by French authoriti<wbr>es following
            his arrest as part of a probe rela<wbr>ted to illegal
            content carried on his messaging app.</span>
            <br><br>
            Durov was freed after paying a €5 million deposit and instructed not to leave France.
            The Kremlin, which is closely watching the case, emphasised his status as a Russian
            citizen and warned against <q>political persecution</q>.
            Russian-born Durov, dressed in black and wearing dark glasses, walked briskly
            out of the Paris court house late Wednesday into a waiting car after being charged
            out but allowed to go free under judicial supervision.
            <br><br>
            Durov, 39, was charged on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal
            content on the popular messaging app which now has over 900 million followers but
            has become increasingly controversial.
            His lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said it was <q>absurd</q> to suggest Durov could be
            implicated in any crime committed on the app, adding: <q>Telegram complies in all
            respects with European rules concerning digital technology.</q>
            <br><br>
            In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned France against turning the case
            into <q>political persecution</q>, emphasising he is a <q>Russian citizen</q> and
            <q>we will be watching what happens next.</q>
            Among those also voicing support for Durov is fellow tech tycoon and chief
            executive of X, Elon Musk, who has posted comments under the hashtag #FreePavel.<br><br>

                a poli<wbr>cy idea that Elon Musk has been pushing him to take on.
                The former president clai<wbr>med the tech billionaire had agreed
                to lead the commission. It was also the first time Trump said
                Musk had agre<wbr>ed to head the body. Trump did not de<wbr>tail how such

                to eliminate <q>fraud and improper payments</q> within six months of being
